# Project Title: Machine Learning-Driven Analysis and Prediction of UFC Fight Outcomes Based on Fighter Styles

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) data to identify distinct fighter styles through clustering techniques and develop a predictive model to forecast fight outcomes using machine learning. By leveraging historical fight data and fighter statistics, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that can enhance understanding of fighter performance and improve prediction accuracy for future bouts.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational purposes and personal use only. The analysis and predictions generated by this project are not meant to be used for gambling or betting activities. The results and insights are based on historical data and machine learning techniques and should be interpreted with caution.

## Goals and Objectives
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather comprehensive UFC fight data from [UFC Stats](http://www.ufcstats.com/)
   - Ensure the collected data includes fighter statistics, fight outcomes, event details, and any other relevant information necessary for analysis.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleanse the collected data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

3. **Clustering Fighter Styles**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to categorize fighters based on their fighting styles.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to identify common traits and strategies.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Develop machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to predict fight outcomes.
   - Train and validate the models using historical fight data.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of fighter styles and the key factors influencing fight outcomes.
   - Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Completion of data collection
- **Milestone 2**: Data preprocessing finished
- **Milestone 3**: Identification of fighter style clusters
- **Milestone 4**: Development of predictive model
- **Milestone 5**: Final report and presentation of findings

## Fighter Styles

### Fighter Styles by Cluster

| Metric       | Cluster 0: Unbalanced Striker          | Cluster 1: Defensive Grappler                     | Cluster 2: Precision All-Rounder                |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|              | Fighters in this cluster are less effective in both striking and grappling, with significant weaknesses in takedown defense. They have balanced stances but struggle in overall combat efficiency. | These fighters excel in grappling, particularly in takedowns and submissions, and have strong defensive capabilities. They are slightly above average in striking but primarily focus on grappling. | This group consists of well-rounded fighters who are precise strikers and effective in grappling. They have above-average takedown accuracy and defense, making them versatile in different combat situations. |
| **Reach**    | Slightly below average                | Below average                                     | Slightly below average                         |

| **Str. Acc.**| Below average                         | Below average                                     | Above average                                  |
| **SApM**     | Average                               | Significantly below average (strong defense)      | Below average                                  |
| **Str. Def.**| Below average                         | Above average (good at avoiding strikes)          | Slightly above average                         |
| **TD Avg.**  | Below average                         | Significantly above average (effective grapplers)| Above average                                  |
| **TD Acc.**  | Below average                         | Above average                                     | Significantly above average                    |
| **TD Def.**  | Significantly below average (vulnerable)| Average                                           | Above average                                  |
