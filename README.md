# Project Title: Machine Learning-Driven Analysis and Prediction of UFC Fight Outcomes Based on Fighter Styles

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) data to identify distinct fighter styles through clustering techniques and develop a predictive model to forecast fight outcomes using machine learning. By leveraging historical fight data and fighter statistics, we seek to uncover patterns and insights that can enhance understanding of fighter performance and improve prediction accuracy for future bouts.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for educational purposes and personal use only. The analysis and predictions generated by this project are not meant to be used for gambling or betting activities. The results and insights are based on historical data and machine learning techniques and should be interpreted with caution.

## Goals and Objectives
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather comprehensive UFC fight data from [UFC Stats](http://www.ufcstats.com/)
   - Ensure the collected data includes fighter statistics, fight outcomes, event details, and any other relevant information necessary for analysis.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Cleanse the collected data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

3. **Clustering Fighter Styles**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) to categorize fighters based on their fighting styles.
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to identify common traits and strategies.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Develop machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to predict fight outcomes.
   - Train and validate the models using historical fight data.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Insights and Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to illustrate the distribution of fighter styles and the key factors influencing fight outcomes.
   - Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
